$IE - Internet Explorer Meme Coin

A Vaporwave-Inspired Solana Token with Dynamic Staking

Abstract

$IE is a meme coin built on Solana, embodying the nostalgic aesthetics of Internet Explorer and the vaporwave culture. Unlike traditional meme tokens, $IE integrates an innovative staking mechanism with dynamic rewards, providing both aesthetic and functional value. This paper outlines the vision, technical structure, tokenomics, staking model, and roadmap for $IE.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

Internet Explorer, once the dominant web browser, has become an iconic meme, symbolizing both nostalgia and obsolescence. $IE aims to immortalize this cultural relic through a meme coin that blends humor, community engagement, and financial incentives. The vaporwave aesthetic complements this vision, evoking early internet nostalgia while integrating cutting-edge blockchain technology.

1.2. Vision

$IE is more than a meme coin—it is a decentralized tribute to internet history. With a staking mechanism that dynamically adjusts rewards based on various parameters, $IE encourages long-term engagement and sustainable tokenomics.

2. Blockchain and Smart Contract Architecture

2.1. Solana Blockchain

Solana was chosen for $IE due to its high-speed transactions, low fees, and strong developer ecosystem. Solana’s Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus ensures a scalable and efficient environment for $IE’s staking mechanics.

2.2. Smart Contract Features

Token Minting: Fixed total supply with deflationary mechanics.

Staking Contract: Implements dynamic reward adjustments.

IE Rank System: Users gain ranks based on staking duration and volume.

Vaporwave UI Integration: Aesthetic elements incorporated in staking dashboards.

3. Tokenomics

3.1. Token Distribution

Total Supply: 999,106,851.10 tokens

Initial Liquidity: % allocated for DEX launch

Staking Rewards: % locked for staking incentives

Community & Marketing: % for ecosystem growth

Development Fund: % for future improvements


3.2. Deflationary Mechanisms

Burn Mechanics: A portion of each transaction may be burned.

Decay Staking: If unstaked early, penalties apply.

Special "Error 404" Events: Random token burns linked to nostalgic browser crashes.

4. Staking Mechanism

4.1. Dynamic Rewards System

Unlike fixed staking returns, $IE dynamically adjusts rewards based on:

Market Volatility: Higher rewards in low-volume periods.

Holder Activity: More rewards for long-term holders.

IE Rank System: Higher ranks yield greater multipliers.


4.2. IE Rank System

Users progress through ranks based on staking duration and amount:

1. Dial-Up User (New Staker)


2. DSL Surfer (1 Month Staked)


3. Broadband Veteran (3 Months Staked)


4. Fiber-Optic Master (6 Months Staked)



Each rank unlocks unique staking multipliers and potential airdrops.
