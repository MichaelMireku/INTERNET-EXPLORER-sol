Internet 1.5: A Next-Generation Decentralized Storage Protocol
Version 1.0 – March 2025

Author: Michael Kwabena Mireku

Abstract

Internet 1.5 is a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, and permanent storage protocol designed to surpass existing solutions like Arweave, Filecoin, and IQ6900. Unlike traditional blockchain storage, it combines Solana smart contracts, an incentive-based storage network, and a self-healing redundancy mechanism to ensure data is permanently stored without reliance on any single entity.

The protocol introduces a tri-layer storage architecture, economic incentives through Proof of Redundancy (PoR), and an immutable indexing layer to optimize long-term accessibility.

Introduction
1.1 The Problem with Existing Storage Solutions

Arweave: Relies on centralized mining pools, lacks true decentralization.

Filecoin: Storage providers can remove files if incentives run out.

IPFS: Files disappear without continuous pinning.

1.2 What Makes Internet 1.5 Different?

Guaranteed permanence: Even if Solana prunes transactions, data persists.

Self-sustaining economy: Incentives for nodes to store data forever.

Redundancy & decentralization: No single point of failure.

Architecture
2.1 Tri-Layer Storage System

Internet 1.5 splits data into three layers:

On-Chain Index Layer (Solana/Custom L2)
Smart contract maintains metadata & hash-based file pointers.

Uses Merkle Trees for data integrity verification.

Immutable, permanent on-chain storage.

Decentralized Storage Layer (P2P Nodes & Redundant Replication)
Uses P2P data propagation to distribute files across multiple nodes.

Nodes compete to store data, ensuring redundancy.

Adaptive Erasure Coding prevents data loss.

Self-Healing Replication Layer (Automated Backup System)
AI-driven redundancy checks.

Data is re-stored if nodes go offline.

Proof of Redundancy (PoR): The Storage Incentive Model
Instead of traditional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, Internet 1.5 uses Proof of Redundancy (PoR):

Nodes prove they are storing a file by signing Merkle Tree proofs.

They receive $IE tokens for every proof submitted.

If a node disappears, another node takes over and gets extra rewards.

Result: Data never disappears and storage providers are always rewarded.

Technical Implementation
4.1 Smart Contracts on Solana

Permanent File Registry: Stores file hashes & metadata.

Storage Incentive Contract: Handles PoR rewards & slashing.

Redundancy Checker: AI ensures data is replicated.

4.2 P2P Network for Storage

Built with Libp2p & Kademlia DHT for efficient file lookup.

Nodes communicate & share storage responsibilities dynamically.

4.3 Data Integrity with Merkle Trees

Ensures files aren’t altered or lost.

Smart contracts validate storage proofs before issuing rewards.

Security & Censorship Resistance
Fully decentralized: No single entity controls the network.

Encrypted storage: Data is split & encrypted before being stored.

AI-driven anti-censorship: Detects and rebalances storage if governments attempt takedowns.

Comparison with Other Systems
Roadmap & Future Plans
Phase 1: MVP Development (Q2 2025) – Deploy smart contracts & testnet.

Phase 2: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2025) – Incentives, node onboarding.

Phase 3: AI-Driven Storage Optimization (2026) – Full self-healing redundancy.

Conclusion

Internet 1.5 is the most advanced decentralized storage protocol, ensuring permanent, censorship-resistant, and self-sustaining data storage. By combining Solana smart contracts, P2P storage, and AI-driven redundancy, it surpasses all existing storage solutions.
